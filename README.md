# Tic-Tac-Toe
Little project by me to test out ASCII, pointers, and some limitations in C

Created in 2022 for experimentation

v1 is the base game of 2 player tic tac toe.

v2 adds a little bit of flavor to the base game.

v3 will make the ode more optimized to get rid of the redundancy, add color, as well as experimenting with coordinates to replace the manual formatting.

## V2 is the latest playable version
